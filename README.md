#TwitterAnalysis

TwitterAnalysis is a (rather ambiguously named) text analysis program that analyses microblog posts for trends. It seeks to identify the stage of trending of topics being discussed in a sample of 16 million (12GB) [1] tweets during a two week period (Jan 23rd - Feb 8th). 
An example of such a trend as found in the data is a spike in term correlates that occurs on Bob Marley's birthday (Feb 6th). The term pair "bob" and "marley" are themselves tightly correlated throughout but not associated with a particular theme until the day of his birthday when another set of significant terms is added to the co-set: "happy" and "birthday".

This information can then be used in the assessment of Query Difficulty by contributing a greater understanding of a terms volatility over time.
